# Random Mod
This is literally a random mod for Minecraft where I experiment with new things I have learned.  
This mod also contains a very poor structure for a Minecraft mod because it's not going to be released but used as a reference if I want to incorporate some things from here into another mod.  
Feel free to browse and use any or all parts of the code.
